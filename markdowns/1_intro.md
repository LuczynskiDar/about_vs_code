# What is VS Code

The app is built using an open source **desktop application framework** developed by GitHub called **[Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/)**.

Electron uses *HTML5*, *JavaScript*, and other *Web technologies*, using *Chromium* for presentation, and *io.js* (a fork of node.js) to tie it all together. **The Code** editor is a version of **[Monaco](https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor)** project.

# The foundation of success

VS Code is not only editor, can be classed as an integrated development environment (IDE), meaning that developers can write and test code at the same time.

With the addition of extensions, it becomes more than just a code editor. With the right settings, extensions, and configured shortcut keys, it can easily become a full-stack workstation.

# Telemetry and Data collection

Visual Studio Code collects usage data and sends it to Microsoft, however this can be disabled.
In addition, because of the open-source nature of the application, the telemetry code is accessible to the public. They can see exactly what is collected.

There is no telemetry community project, called **[VS Codium](https://vscodium.com)**, the source is available **[here](https://github.com/VSCodium/vscodium)**
